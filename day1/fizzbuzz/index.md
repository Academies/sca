# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a classic tech interview question. Your objective is to
print out all the numbers from 1 to 100, but for numbers that are
divisible by 3 you should print `"Fizz"` instead, and for numbers that
are divisible by 5 you should print `"Buzz"` intead. For any number
divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print `"FizzBuzz"`.

Here's what the first 10 lines of output should look like.

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
FizzBuzz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
```

### Roadmap

1. Print the numbers 1 to 100
2. Print `"Fizz"`on multiples of 3
3. Finish by adding printing of `"Buzz"` and `"FizzBuzz"`

### Testing

Once you finish, check your solution by running `check50 fizzbuzz` in the terminal (TODO(tlively): implement check).
